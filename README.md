When you learn a new framework, you sometimes get to start fresh, from scratch, with plenty of time. Other times, though, you need to dive right in and get things done. This hands-on course helps you quickly get up to speed with React—the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces—by allowing you to change code directly as you follow along. Instructor Ray Villalobos highlights the aspects of React that set it apart from other JavaScript libraries, including how to approach templating and React Hooks. He then details how to build with React and use it in a web project.<br><br>The best way to learn a framework is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
